The package europopgridviewer is a simple shiny application build with
the help of the golem package which allows you to load [Eurostat
population
grids](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=Population_grids)
into an R [mapdeck](https://github.com/SymbolixAU/mapdeck) based map
viewer. It currently only allows to download the 10km and 5km grid,
mainly due to processing requirements of more granular resolutions. To
fetch the data, it uses the [giscoR
package](https://ropengov.github.io/giscoR/).

## Installation

  - Install R: <https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html> (version 4.1.1
    or greater)

  - Install R Studio: <https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/>
    (version 1.2.5001-3 or newer)

  - Make sure the *devtools* package is installed, if not install it
    with:

<!-- end list -->

``` r
install.packages("devtools")
```

  - After that install the actual package:

<!-- end list -->

``` r
devtools::install_github("michael-cw/europopgridviewer")
```

## Start the application

Start R Studio and run the following commands:

``` r
library(europopgridviewer)
europopgridviewer::run_app(mapboxkey = [Your key goes her])
```

This will load the default map for all the members of the European
Statistical System.

After having selected a country as well as the desired grid layer (5km
or 10km) with the two drop down inputs in the sidebar, the application
will load the grid onto the map.

In case you want to use the map in an external file, like i.e.Â a
presentation or a report, you can also download the map by clicking
*Download PDF*.

When using the map externally make sure, that you also use the
[giscoR](https://ropengov.github.io/giscoR/) package attribution, which
is shown on the *Info* tab.

## Help for run time parameters

To learn about the individual run time parameters, please run the
following commands:

``` r
?europopgridviewer::run_app
```

This will give you all the information required. The most important one
is the [mapbox key](https://www.mapbox.com/pricing) for the base map. In
case you are not using a [mapbox key](https://www.mapbox.com/pricing),
the application will still work, however it will only display the layer
without any background map.
